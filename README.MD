# stock-tracker: Simple Stock Portfolio Tracker

[Check it out](https://simple-stock-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

This project uses the Heroku cloud platform to host a simple stock portfolio tracker, with all data stored and updated live on MongoDB Atlas.

## Skills Developed
* Express.js - developed a simple RESTful API for updating cloud data
* MongoDB - app connects to the MongoDB Atlas service for database management
* Heroku - used to provide live cloud hosting
* Next.js
* React.js - app created using hooks
* Notable Node Modules
    * [react-chartist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartist) - used and customized for all chart graphics
    * [react-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-date-picker) - popup date selector

## Project Conclusions
* Creating my own Express RESTful API was somewhat daunting at first, but ended up helping me feel a lot more comfortable with cloud-based design.  It also helped me gain an better understanding of routing within Next.js apps.
* I gained experience in cloud database management and working with cloud platforms (Heroku, MongoDB Atlas).  There were a variety of new challenges to overcome when developing this app, with it being a dynamic web page connected to a cloud database (rather than static)
